# Stock Prediction & Backtesting Assignment (with backtesting.py)

## Problem Statement

You are provided with historical financial market data (`input.csv`). Your task is to design and implement a predictive pipeline or rule-based strategy to model stock behavior and simulate the performance of your framework within a realistic trading environment using the `backtesting.py` library.

## Objectives

- Understand the structure and challenges of financial time series data.  
- Engineer meaningful features and signals from historical data, either through machine learning or technical indicators.  
- Develop a prediction or rule-based strategy using ML models, technical indicators, or a hybrid approach.  
- Evaluate signal performance with appropriate metrics.  
- Simulate and evaluate the strategy using `backtesting.py`.  
- Visualize both model or rule performance and trading results for deeper insights.

## Expectations

### 1. Data Pipeline Design

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
  Handle missing values, parse time formats, resample if needed, align data correctly.

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Depending on your approach, this may include:
  - **For ML-based strategies**: Lagged returns, volatility, momentum, etc.
  - **For indicator-based strategies**: Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.
  - **Hybrid approach**: Use indicators as model features or as rules for trade confirmation.

- **Signal or Target Construction:**  
  - ML-based: Predict return direction or value (regression/classification)
  - Indicator-based: Define buy/sell conditions using crossovers, thresholds, etc.

### 2. Strategy Design

You may choose from one of the following or combine them:

- **Machine Learning Based Strategy**:  
  Train a model to predict a future market condition (e.g., direction, return) and act based on the prediction.

- **Technical Indicator Based Strategy**:  
  Use well-defined trading rules (e.g., SMA crossover, RSI < 30 = buy) to generate signals.

- **Hybrid Strategy**:  
  Use both: e.g., a model predicts direction, and you enter only if RSI confirms.

Ensure your strategy avoids lookahead bias and uses time-aware validation.

### 3. Evaluation

- **ML Strategy Evaluation**:  
  - Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC  
  - Regression: MAE, MSE, R²  
  - Rolling/backtest-time-split validation  
  - Feature importance or SHAP plots (optional)

- **Technical/Rule-based Strategy Evaluation**:  
  - Trade statistics: win rate, average win/loss  
  - Signal frequency & hit rate  
  - Sensitivity to indicator parameters

### 4. Backtesting with `backtesting.py`

- Implement your strategy using `backtesting.py` by subclassing `Strategy`.
- Include realistic trading assumptions:
  - **Transaction costs** (e.g., 0.1% per trade)
  - **Slippage** if applicable
  - **Position sizing rules** (fixed size, fraction of equity, etc.)

**Key evaluation metrics** to include from the backtest:

- Equity curve  
- Total & annualized return  
- Maximum drawdown  
- Sharpe ratio  
- Trade-level statistics (win rate, avg return per trade, etc.)

### 5. Visualization & Reporting

Your notebook should include clear visualizations:

- **Equity Curve** from backtesting  
- **Performance Metrics** (ML or rule-based)  
- **Indicator/Signal Charts** (show trades on price chart)  
- **Drawdowns and Volatility**  
- Any additional diagnostics that help explain your strategy’s behavior

## Deliverables

- A well-documented **Jupyter Notebook** or **Python script** named: `stock_prediction.ipynb`  
- Clean, modular code with inline explanations and comments  
- Markdown sections summarizing:  
  - **Strategy Approach (ML, Indicator-based, or Hybrid)**  
  - **Key Features and Assumptions**  
  - **Performance Summary (prediction or signal quality)**  
  - **Backtesting Results and Strategic Takeaways**
